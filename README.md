The Next Generation Gradebook for the Sakai CLE

### This project has moved!
As of December 2015, this project is now a core module in the Sakai CLE. A huge thanks to everyone involved in this project, this is a great achievement. The heavy hitters were @jeffpasch, @kyleblythe, @payten and myself @steveswinsburg and to anyone I have missed or don't know your github handle, thanks again!

This project will continue to be developed inside the Sakai CLE. You can find it here: https://github.com/sakaiproject/sakai

Please file any issues or pull requests against that project. Feel free to @steveswinsburg me too.
